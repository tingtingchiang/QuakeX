			<article>
				<p>According to USGS statistics, about every 30 seconds, an earthquake occurs somewhere in the world. In fact, <a href = "http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eqarchives/year/eqstats.php">they estimate</a> that "several million earthquakes occur in the world each year". </p>
				<span class="question">Will you be near one?</span>
				<p>Of course, not everyone lives near a <em>known</em> fault line, but it's good to be prepared. After all, when there isn't an earthquake, everything might seem fine, perfect even. But when that quake strikes, you're going to be suprised.</p>
				<p>It might even be a - shock.</p>
				<p>In those few precious seconds before and after an earthquake strikes, you need to be on your toes. Those critical moments could mark how prepared you are for the future.</p>
				<span class ="question">But what do you do?</span>

				<h3>LOCATION</h4>
				<p>Where you are in relation to known fault lines affects how much urgent earthquake preparedness is. And when an earthquake does happen in your area, where you are in relation to the epicenter is a huge factor between hiding and fleeing. Being further away from the center increases the time you have before the shock hits you.</p>
				<span class="question">Where will you be safe?</span>
			</article>
			<hr>
			<article>
				<h3>PREPARATION</h4>
				<p>Imagine. Seconds before the earthquake strikes, you get an alert. You're surprised, sure, but now you have a few seconds to get under cover, gather family members, or collect belongings. What do you target first? Do you even know where to find them?</p>
				<span class="question">What are you priorities?</span>
			</article>
			<hr>
			<article>
				<h3>TRANSPORTATION</h3>
				<p>Let's assume you make it through a major earthquake. Next steps would include moving out of impacted areas to safety. Your first instinct may be to get in your car and drive down the road. Even if the car hasn't been damaged, you've got problems ahead of you. It seems like everyone else has the same idea, the roads are congested like the LA highway during rush hour. Besides, the government needs the roads relatively cleared so they can begin their own emergency procedures.</p>

				<h3>RESOURCES</h3>
				<p>You made it out alive, but do you have everything you need? Water, food, extra clothing, toiletries, emergency cash? Probably not, meaning you'll need to purchase them. Without cash, your only solution is to access your funds from your bank. But at this time, banks are most likely crowded by others in the same situation as you. There's no way you can get the supplies you need in time.</p>
				<span class="question">Where do you go?</span>

			<article>
				<p>Too many questions, not enough time. You've only got a few seconds during an earthquake.</p><span class="question">What do you do?</span>
